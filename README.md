# choose-your-own-adventure
A Choose Your Own Adventure (CYOA) style game, influenced from books I used to read in the library during grade school. You play a nameless protagonist who must ________

I was unfortunately unable to finish this project during the given timeframe due to work from other classes and extracurricular activities as finals season approached. At this moment, the project is roughly 1/2-2/3rds done. 

During this project, I struggled a bit at the beginning when working through the Ren'Py library documentation. It was also hard for me to envision the plot structure I wanted my game to follow as well as add in branching choices that lead to bad endings. I initially wanted to have a point-based system that would determine the ending, but felt that a lack of immediate consequences (bad endings) would lessen the perceived importance of choices in the game for players. As such, I reworked the story to end the game early upon a bad choice and automatically grant the best "true" ending for reaching the conclusion.

I had a lot of melodic bits and pieces composed prior to the project; during the course of story development, I added simple endings to my songs and refined them to fit the atmosphere I wanted to present in the game. For example, the song "DREAM" that plays in the first act of the game is meant to mirror the wistful feelings of the protagonist for a past he can no longer remember. In actuality, the music development for this game took an overall longer time than the coding itself (minus getting more familiar with the Ren'Py library).
