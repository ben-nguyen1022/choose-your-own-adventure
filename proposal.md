# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

DREAM

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A visual novel game coded using the game engine Ren'Py, featuring branching paths and different endings.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The game will focus on a text-based adventure with a story-driven narrative, using the available engine Ren'Py. There will be three (3) endings available at the end of a given playthrough, with 'GAME OVER' assignments given for particularly egregious decisions straying from the narrative.

An old man's dream at the end of his life. Featuring characters and backgrounds with a self-composed soundtrack, DREAM is a game meant to be simple at first glance but thought-provoking in execution. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

This project is original and was not made for any past course. The primary aspects of the project that would relate to 1051 are file manipulation and conditional statements (if-else). 

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

The game is partially coded in Ren'Py, with at least one full ending path designed; background but no character designs. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The text-based portion of the game is coded in Ren'Py, with all three endings implemented; background with some character assets, limited amounts of music. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The full game is coded in Ren'Py, with all three endings implemented; background with some character assets, music fully composed with 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one or two classmates, who will do what?

I will need to learn how to code in the Ren'Py environment and create a storyboard/outline for the narrative portion of the story, as well as brush up on my music theory skills for composing a piano-based soundtrack (chords, harmonizing). As a stretch goal, I would also like to learn basic principles of drawing in order to design my own characters for the game. I would start with outlining the story for my game and gain experience with Ren'Py through a series of simple exercises (getting a game to launch, creating a simple Do/Die ending, etc.)
